      <p>
        Welcome to my r3source passion project! This will be an ongoing project that’ll be going for who knows how long LOL.
        As of right now, I’m just figuring out and making the general layout for the website before I start adding r3sources n all that fun jazz!
        I am open to criticism as this is only my 2nd website that I’ve published publicly!
        Thank you for visiting r3source! You may visit the update logs below if you want to read the progress of the website.
