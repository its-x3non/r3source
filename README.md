# Welcome to r3source!

r3sources is pretty much a personal project of mine that tries to collect alternatives to paid services.

There are a bunch of “free resources” websites out there but I would like to put my own spin to it :)

## Why is it named “r3source”?
I put a 3 in my name (x3non), I put a 3 in r3sources (except the last one).
Also I think it looks aesthetically pleasing.

## What happened to the old site?
I wanted to use glitch as I'm more familiar with this site as I used this site before for another [personal project of mine that I did back in high school](https://complex-reactions.glitch.me/).

## I built this website with Glitch :3
